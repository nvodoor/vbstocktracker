# vbstocktracker

This project entailed taking stock data from the year 2016 and using Visual Basic code to take that information and present the following information for each stock:
- Total Change for the year.
- % Change for the year.
- Average Daily Change for the year.
- Total Volume for the year.

In addition, I used VBA to color code the Total Change per year to show whether a stock gained value or lost value.

Furthermore, I also gathered the following information at the end and placed them in separate cells:
- Greatest Decrease for Individual Stock.
- Greatest Increase for Individual Stock.
- Greatest Average Change for Individual Stock.
- Greatest Volumef or Individual Stock.
